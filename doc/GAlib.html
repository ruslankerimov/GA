There are two mailing lists to which you may subscribe:
<blockquote>
<dl>
  <dt>galib@mit.edu
  <dd><small>This is an unmoderated mailing list for GAlib users.  If you have found use for GAlib and would like to let other users know about it, or if you're having problems with GAlib, post it to this mailing list and one of the other subscribers just might be able to help you out.  I read all messages that are posted to this list, but I cannot respond to every one.</small>
       <br>
       <br>
  <dt>galib-announce@mit.edu
  <dd><small>This mailing list is for announcements about updates to GAlib.  The only messages sent to recipients of this list are announcements from me about revisions to GAlib.  This typically amounts to about one or two emails per year.</small>
