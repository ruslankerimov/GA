Example 10

This program uses sharing to do speciation.  The objective
function has more than one optimum, so different genomes
may have equally high scores.  Speciation keeps the population
from clustering at one optimum.
  Both gene-wise and phenotype-wise distance functions are used.
  Populations from all three runs are written to the files 
pop.nospec.dat, pop.genespec.dat and pop.phenespec.dat.  The
function is written to the file sinusoid.dat

to put them in descending order from 24 to 0.

Example 12

This program illustrates the use of order-based strings.  The
string in this problem contains 26 letters, a to z.  It tries
to put them in alphabetic order.

the ga generated the following string (objective score is 26):
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
GAStringGenome
Example 13

This program runs a GA-within-GA.  The outer level GA tries to
match the pattern read in from a file.  The inner level GA is
run only when the outer GA reaches a threshhold objective score
then it tries to match a sequence of numbers that were generated
randomly at the beginning of the program's execution.

You might have to run the primary GA for more than 5000
generations to get a score high enough to kick in the secondary
genetic algorithm.  Use the ngen option to do this on the
command line.

This example shows how to create a genome that contains
a list of lists.  We create a composite genome that has
lists in it.  Each list has some nodes, only one of which
contains the number 0.  The objective is to move the node with
number 0 in it to the nth position where n is the number of the
list within the composite genome.

Example 18

This program is designed to compare the GA types.  You can
specify steady-state, incremental, or simple GA and tweak any
of the parameters for each of these GA types.  The objective
function tries to match a pattern read in from a file.

Example 23

This program tries to maximize or minimize, depending on the
command line argument that you give it.  Use the command-line
argument 'mm -1' to minimize (the default for this example), or
'mm 1' to maximize.  The objective function is a simple 
sinusoidal.

Example 24

This example illustrates how to derive your own genetic
algorithm.  This genetic algorithm does restricted mating and
uses a selector slightly more finicky than a uniform random
selector.  The objective function is a simple sinusoidal.
